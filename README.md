# Filament_Playground_SA

INTRO:  
This repo is a playground for Google's Filament rendering engine. Filament is lightweighted, fast, and very elegant in my opinion. I'll provide some standalone Filament samples in this repo. The samples rely on the released filament libraries, and I tried to keep the dependencies minimum. I hope in this way the Filament learners will find it easy to get started in their Filament journey.
